# Design report

## About the beginning of the project
In the beginning of the project the bohongo team started analysing the project and writing on a whiteboard ideas and plans for the upcoming design and function.

## The initial design

The first design of the report was to have a simple tic tac toe game that would hold the score for player 1 and player 2. The game should tell if x won or o won or if the game would end in a draw. The project didn't have any demands to focus on the appearance of the game but only the functionality and backend programming structure. As seen below the game design was simple.
